# statistic-analyzer-tool
An application that makes analyzing datasets easier. It will be able to describe the basics of a dataset (mean, median, mode, range, etc.), create regression models (simple, multiple, polynomial), create classification models (logistic, KNN, naive bayes), display the results of the models, and visualize data with graphs.

Libraries:
- python-dotenv
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- pandas

Goals:
- improve machine learning and statistics knowledge
- better understand Python libraries for data analysis
